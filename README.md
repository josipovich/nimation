## nimation

(Spinning) animation generation made with [react](https://github.com/facebook/react), [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and [react-easy-state](https://github.com/solkimicreb/react-easy-state).



Demo is running [here](https://nimation.herokuapp.com/) - Be warned that animation is quite flashy and if you can't handle that - please avoid it. 

Effect is accomplished by spinning up DOM nodes really fast. Some basic controls are supported: 

- Element size/scale
- Element color
- Element shape (`triangle`, `circle` and `square`)
- Element animations (`pulse` and `fly`)
- Element order (`z-index`)
- Rotation speed
- Background color

Taking screenshots doesn't really give nice results but taking photos with your camera (phone, DSLR, etc.) especially with longer shutter speeds should give some nice shapes. 

**IE isn't supported, sorry.**
